### **Important** note when running your shakespeare program
For the [SPL interpreter that I'm using](https://github.com/zmbc/shakespearelang/), the current version on the main branch has some issues with python 3.10+ and other issues I've noticed with certain nouns and adjectives such as "summer's day" and "fat-kidneyed", so please use the first release candidate version 1.0.0rc1 of the interpreter (found [here](https://pypi.org/project/shakespearelang/1.0.0rc1/)) when using this library.
